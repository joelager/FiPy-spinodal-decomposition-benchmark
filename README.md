# Spinodal Decomposition Benchmark in FiPy

This repository contains an implementation of the
[CHiMaD Phase Field](https://pages.nist.gov/chimad-phase-field) benchmark
[Spinodal Decomposition problem](https://pages.nist.gov/chimad-phase-field/benchmarks/benchmark1.ipynb/)
using [FiPy](https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy).

In addition to benchmarking our code, this repository is intended to test the use
of [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for automatic comparisons of benchmark results.
